This is a GNU screen applet for displaying the time until
charged or time until discharged for a laptop running Linux
3.  For whatever reason, the sys filesystem doesn't always
provide the same paths for the battery status information so
this code occasionally fails to provide any useful
information.

Add the following to your '.screenrc'.

hardstatus on
hardstatus alwayslastline
hardstatus string "%=%w%=%D %M%d %c %1`"
backtick 1 5 0 /path/to/batt

Replace /path/to with the actual path to your copy of the
batt Lua program. You may have to change the value of
battery_path in cat_battery_proc. This path is probably
hardware dependent.
